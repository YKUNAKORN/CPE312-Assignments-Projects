# CPE312 - Introduction to Data Science

This repository contains course materials, assignments, Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and example code used in the CPE312 - Introduction to Data Science course.

Contents:
- `1-Project-Book-Scraping`: Book-scraping project notebooks and CSV datasets.
- `2-Kick-Off-DS-Capstone-Project`: Capstone kickoff notebooks and cleaned data files.
- `Lec03-Python for DS`, `Lec04-DataCollection`, `Lec05-DataPreparation_Visualization`: Lecture notebooks, example code, and supplementary materials.

How to use:
- Open the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code to run and explore analyses.
- Datasets are stored as CSV files; use Python (pandas) to reproduce or extend the exercises.

If you'd like, I can add a `requirements.txt` or a short usage guide for running the notebooks.
